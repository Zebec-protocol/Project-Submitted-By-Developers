War : The Conquer is based in the history of Unification of Nepal

We have created this game in the history of Great conqueror and King of Nepal ""Prithvi Narayan Shah""  to show how he and the bravest Gorkhas conquered ""Baise Chaubise Rajya"" to make  ""Greater Nepal"".","Subit Dhakal, Pramesh Dhakal,Yuvraj Swar",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SubitRambo.WarTheConquers,"Sorry, I cannot provide a link.

Since every thing is transforming into digital form one way or the other, we thought it would indeed be a fruitful business idea to take the psychotherapy to people around the world without their having to even leave their room. This project, after its completion, would give certified psychotherapists a platform to conduct their therapy, touching and reforming the lives of even more people, ridding them of their mental illnesses and emotional problems. One of the main advantages of this project would be the fact that it would allow many emotionally disturbed people who want to join therapy but cant due to low self-esteem or family problems to get therapy without even having to disclose their identity. I firmly believe that this project has a great potential.

How integrating Zebec block chain would be a good idea?
Psychotherapy nowadays requires people to either pay on a certain period basis, or by the hour. With this project, you could pay by the minute, or even by the second. This way, the interested users would be charged justly, proving further the point that this idea would be a hit around the world. Similarly, the therapists would also be paid justly. Therefore, it's a win-win situation we are talking about in here.","Rahul Kharel
